# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Objective
Perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to group customers based on purchasing behavior.

## Task Roadmap

### 1. Data Collection
- **Source:** Customer dataset with purchasing information ( www.kaggle.com ).
- **Features:** Identify and understand the features relevant for segmentation, such as customer demographics, purchase history, and transaction values.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Handle Missing Values:** Identify and impute or remove missing data.
- **Standardize Data:** Normalize or standardize features to ensure they have similar scales.
- **Feature Scaling:** Apply scaling techniques to improve clustering performance.

### 3. Clustering
- **Algorithm:** Implement K-Means clustering to group customers into clusters.
- **Determine Optimal Clusters:** Use methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to find the optimal number of clusters.

### 4. Analysis
- **Cluster Interpretation:** Analyze and profile each customer segment to understand their characteristics and behavior.
- **Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate the clusters and the distribution of customers within each cluster.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for K-Means clustering and model evaluation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab
