# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Churn
## Objective
### Conduct an exploratory data analysis on a customer churn dataset to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding customer behavior and predicting churn.

## Task Roadmap

### 1. Data Collection

- **Dataset**: Obtain the customer churn dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or a similar source.
  - **Features**: Review dataset features such as customer demographics, account information, and churn status.
  - **Target Variable**: Identify the target variable that indicates whether a customer has churned or not (e.g., `Churn` column).

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Handle Missing Values**:
  - Identify missing values and choose appropriate strategies for imputation or removal.

- **Handle Outliers**:
  - Detect outliers using statistical methods or visualization techniques and decide on appropriate handling strategies.

- **Normalize or Standardize Data**:
  - Normalize or standardize features to ensure they have a similar scale and improve model performance.

### 3. Exploratory Analysis

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Use statistical methods to understand the distributions of different features.
  - Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Histograms**: Visualize the distribution of numerical features.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Examine relationships between features and the target variable.
  - **Correlation Matrices**: Use heatmaps to show correlations between features.

- **Pattern Identification**:
  - Identify patterns and potential predictors of churn using visual and statistical methods.

### 4. Report Generation

- **Comprehensive Report**:
  - Create a detailed report summarizing findings and insights from the analysis.
  - Include visualizations and statistical summaries to support observations.
