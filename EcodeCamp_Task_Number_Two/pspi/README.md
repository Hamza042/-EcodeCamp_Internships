# Real-Time Stock Price Prediction System

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a real-time stock price prediction system utilizing historical stock data. This system involves collecting data through APIs, building and training a time-series forecasting model, and deploying it via a Django web application for real-time predictions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for data processing, model training, and web development.
- **Django**: Web framework for deploying the application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Model evaluation and preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning libraries for LSTM model development.
- **Yahoo Finance API**: For retrieving historical stock data.

## Task Roadmap

### 1. Data Collection
- Utilize financial APIs (Yahoo Finance) to collect historical stock data.
- Pre-process the data, including feature engineering and scaling.

### 2. Model Building
- Develop a forecasting model using LSTM or ARIMA.
- Evaluate the model's performance to ensure accuracy.

### 3. Real-Time Implementation
- Deploy the model using Django.
- Create a user interface to display real-time stock predictions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
cd YourRepository
