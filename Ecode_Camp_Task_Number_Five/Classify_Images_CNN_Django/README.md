# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to categorize images into different classes. This system involves collecting an image CIFAR-10 dataset, preprocessing the data, building and training a CNN model, and deploying it via a web application for real-time image classification.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for data processing, model training, and web development.
- **Django**: Web framework for deploying the application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Model evaluation and preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning libraries for LSTM model development.
- **Image Classification Dataset**: CIFAR-10 Dataset.

## Task Roadmap

### 1. Data Collection
- Use an image classification dataset with labeled images (CIFAR-10).
- Review image features and class labels.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Resize and normalize images.
- Augment data to improve model performance.

### 3. Model Building
- Build a CNN architecture with layers such as Convolutional, Pooling, and Dense.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy.

### 4. Deployment
- Deploy the model using a web framework (Django) for real-time image classification.
- Create a user interface to upload and classify images.

## Setup Instructions

Here's a detailed README.md file for Image Classification system project. This file includes instructions on setting up and using the project, as well as an overview of the tools and technologies involved.


### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv env
```

### Windows:
### Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
cd env\Scripts\actiavte
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
### macOS/Linux:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Requirements
#### Ensure you have a requirements.txt file with the necessary packages. If not, create one:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
### Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Apply Migrations (Django)
#### Apply the database migrations for Django:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Run the Application
#### Start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Usage
#### Once the server is running, you can access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Use the web interface to upload images and receive predictions on their classification.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamza042/EcodeCamp_Internships.git
cd EcodeCamp_Internships/EcodeCamp_Task_Number_Five
